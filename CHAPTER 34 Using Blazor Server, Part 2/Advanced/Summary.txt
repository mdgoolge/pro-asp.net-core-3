Chapter 32
In this chapter, I showed how to create the example application that is used throughout this part of the book. The project was created
with the Empty template, and it contains a data model that relies on Entity Framework Core and handles requests using a controller
and a Razor Page. In the next chapter, I introduce Blazor, which is a new addition to ASP.NET Core.

Chapter 33 
In this chapter, I introduced Blazor Server, explained the problem it solves, and described the advantages and disadvantages it
presents. I showed you how to configure an ASP.NET Core application to enable Blazor Server and showed you the basic features
that are available when using Razor Components, which are the Blazor building blocks. In the next chapter, I continue to describe
the features provided by Blazor.
